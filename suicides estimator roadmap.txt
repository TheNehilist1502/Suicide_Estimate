suicides estimator
..........................
* What I want?
To detect if there is any interventions that can be done to prevent suicides.
* How can this be done?

-> Available data: 

1. data of suicides in year 2016 with health facilities and human resources
What we can get from it:
- availability for mental health care among different countries
- the distribution of male and female suicides among countries 
2. data of different causes of death / suicide deaths
- a comparison between the differnt causes of death among countries in the last 20 years
3. Happiness report
- shows the rank of happiness to different countries and related factors(gdp- family- economy- freedom..etc)
 4. master dataset
 - suicides numbers genderdized from year 1985-2016 based on different factors.

 -> The final product:

 1. Analysis combining the first 3 datasets
 2.This will be splitted into 2 parts:
 1st part: For general mental health organizations. 
 2.1we can compile a dataset from country, sex, age range & happiness index to build a model to predict the suicide rates.
 2.2 we can add "know more about possible causes" which could show statistically according to the country which was choosen; the detail of the happiness index, human resources & facilities. And show according to category(categorizing can be done by calculating each value specified in the happiness index labels retrieved to a scale[search for arithmetic scale for each label]) of (bad, not a problem, good) the low things of labels of happiness index as a possible causes for this suicide rate.
 2.2.1 If there is no bad or not a problem in explaining then a msg is shown telling that: "These suicides may be caused of depression or failure on the personals’ lives" 
 2nd part: For individuals health
 2.3 Providing a test to make sure about customers’ mental health and the possibilty to commit suicide.
